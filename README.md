# color_detection_opencv2
Color Detection using OpenCV is a beginner-friendly Python project that demonstrates how to detect specific colors in an image using the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space. The script identifies and highlights regions of Blue, Red, Green, and Yellow in a static image.  This is useful for learning how color spaces work in computer vision.
